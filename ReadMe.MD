This is my dangerous tool. Can be used to take down networks/websites. I am not responsible for your guys actions, I made this for educational purposes. Have fun. 
Thanks to NeuralNine for tutorial on the DDos. https://www.neuralnine.com/code-a-ddos-script-in-python/
Also Thanks to my friend Cobra for helping me on the port scanner and getting ip address. Take a look at his github: https://github.com/FURRO404
